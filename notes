Notes on Alexa App:

Goal for this app:

The Alexa App allows you to input your location, destination, and arrival time to say what time you should leave to get to where you want to be. It should facilitate travel by public transportation, which uses a schedule.

Assumptions: Transportation is by transit.
Uncertainty: Does it account for subways? Is it reliable for other cities’ public transportation systems?

2/6/20 2:53PM:
Deprecated to take in current location rather than get location of device. Future release will have a device location option.
    def getAddress(self, context):
        # get device id
        device_id = context.system.device.device_id

        # get Alexa Settings API information
        api_endpoint = context.system.api_endpoint
        api_access_token = context.system.api_access_token

         # construct systems api timezone url
        url = '{api_endpoint}/v2/devices/{device_id}/settings/address'.format(api_endpoint=api_endpoint, device_id=device_id)
        headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_access_token}
        userAddress = ""
        try:
            r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            res = r.json()
            userAddress = res
        except Exception:
            pass

        return userAddress



Removed code:
        # location given here
        #origin = "1368 E 28th Street Oakland CA"
	#other base variables here


        #logger.info(str(dir(time_response)))
        #logger.info("Before :" + str(time_response))
	#time reponse here

        #logger.info(time_response)
	#arrival_time math below

	#above params set
        #timestamp = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(time_response.timestamp())
        #logger.info(str(timestamp))

Starting goals for this project:
Have an Alexa routine that tells me what time I should leave every morning to arrive at my destination.

Future releases:
More transit options. Support place ids/names, not just physical address (may have a problem with same name locations (i.e. chain locations)).

Fixes:
Fixes need to be made for null or incorrect values and am/pm time adjustments. Error handling for response.
