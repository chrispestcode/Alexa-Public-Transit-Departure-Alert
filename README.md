Do you find yourself trying to navigate public transit schedules? Why can't being punctual and eco-friendly be easier?

The Public Transit Departure Alert tells the user what time to depart to reach a destination at a specific time by public transit. Alexa only needs an origin address, destination address, and a desired arrival time. The alert will return the best-chance public transit stop location and departure time. There are no account or hardware prerequisites.

Just say, "Alexa, open public transit departure" to get started!
